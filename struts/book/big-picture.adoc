.Flow
. Request go to ServletContainer
. Pass to the stander filter chain
. Next the FilterDispatcher is called which consults the ActionMapper to determine if an action is present for the request
. If an Action is present, it delegates control to ActionProxy
. ActionProxy consults the framwork configuration files manager
. ActionProxy create an ActionInvocation
. ActionInvocation is responsible for invoking Interceptors and after invoking Action
. After Action return the ActionInvocation is responsible for looking up the
correct result response, mapped to the Action result in the struts.xml
. The resutl is execute
. The interceptor are execute in inverse order
. The response is returned to the server through the filter chain defined into the web.xml

=== Object Factory

Object factory creats all the object used by the framework like Interceptors,Action,Resul ...

Cusomized object factory must extends `ObjectFactory` . To register a custom object
factory edit the `struts.properties`

[source]
----
struts.objectFactory=foo.bar.MyCustomObjectFactory
----

Implementation class:

[source,java]
----
public class MyObjectFactory extends ObjectFactory {
    //.....
}
----

If you want to extend only part of ObjectFactory you can implement:

* ResultFactory
* ActionFactory
* InterceptorFactory
* ValidatorFactory
* ConverterFactory
* UnknownHandlerFactory

=== Action Mapper

Action Mapper provides a mapping between HTTP request and action invocation request and vice-versa.
The default implementation uses the *.[ext] pattern where ext is usally //action//.
This mapper also has the ability to name a button with some prefix and have that
button name alter the execution behavoir.

* `method:default`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<s:form action="baz">
    <s:textfield label="Enter your name" name="person.name"/>
    <s:submit value="Create person"/>
    <s:submit method="anotherMethod" value="Cancel"/>
</s:form>
----

* `action:dashboard`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<s:form action="baz">
    <s:textfield label="Enter your name" name="person.name"/>
    <s:submit value="Create person"/>
    <s:submit action="anotherAction" value="Cancel"/>
</s:form>
----

You can define you custom action mapper implmenting
` org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.mapper.ActionMapper` and setting  in struts.xml

[source,xml]
----
<bean type="org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.mapper.ActionMapper" name="mymapper"
  class="com.mycompany.myapp.MyActionMapper" />
<constant name="struts.mapper.class" value="mymapper" />
----

Delegate to other ActionMapper based on the request url
[source,xml]
----
<constant name="struts.mapper.class" value="org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.mapper.PrefixBasedActionMapper" />
<constant name="struts.mapper.prefixMapping" value="/rest:restful2,:struts" />
----

=== Action Proxy

Obtains the Action class and call the appropriate method. An  ActionProxy is created
with and ActionFactory. Typically, an ActionProxy will utilize the ActionInvocation
to encapsulate the execution of a particular request. Essentially, ActionProxy
encapsulates how an Action can be obtained. ActionInvocation encapsulates how the
Action is executed when a request is invoked.
