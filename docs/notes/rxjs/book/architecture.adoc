== Architecture Overview

Rxjs is library to manage asynchronous and event-based programs using sequence of _Observable_.
There is one core type _Observable_ plus operators to allow asynchronous event of collections.

The essensial concepts are:

[horizontal]
Observable:: invokable collections of futrure values or events.
Observer:: collections of callback that liston to value delivered by Observable.
Subscription::  execution of an Observable.
Operators:: pure functions to enable functional programming style to handle collections of Observables.
Subject:: like an EventEmitter and the only way to multicast a value to multiple Observers.
Schedulers:: dispatcher to controll concurrency
